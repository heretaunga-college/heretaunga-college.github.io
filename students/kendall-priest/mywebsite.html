<h2 class="futuretitle">My Future</h2>

<p> In the future I want to become an auto-electrician. What auto eletricians do Is they fix up the computers or electronics on cars, trucks, boats and other types of vehicles. The main reason I want to do this job is because I really like cars and electronics and this job mixes them both together</p>
