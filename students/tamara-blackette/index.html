<h1>All About Me: Tamara-Rose Blackette</h1>
<p class="text">I am a 16 year old girl who moved to New Zealand from England in 2003. I have English, Scottish, Welsh and West-Indian heritage and possibly many others. I live with my parents, my Spoodle Louie and my Ragdoll cat Ozzy. I attend Heretaunga College in Upper Hutt.I am in many fandoms especially on Tumblr and watch some TV shows like Supernatural, Once Upon a Time, Downtown Abbey and 2 Broke Girls. I also know how to play the Piano and love listening to a variety of music.I love drawing and colouring and I am paticularly good with charcoal drawings. My best drawing skill is to copy pictures that I like very accurately.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p class="text">I spend a lot of time on Tumblr and gaming on either the PS3, Xbox 360 or my laptop. Dragon Age is my favourite game but I also like Mass Effect, Fable, Skyrim and The Sims. I have been a gamer since I can remember, the first game I ever played was one of the original Lara Croft: Tomb Raider games made for the Playstation Pal or 1 as it is better known as. I have been playing The Sims series for 8 or 9 years now and had the original sims on the ps2. I cannot wait for the Sims 4 to come out this year. I have played all of the Dragon Age and Mass Effect games and am eager for Dragon Age: Inquisition to come out around September this year. I also love reading on my Kobo tablet or physical books.</p>

<h2>My Future</h2>
<p class="text">If Yoobee has the right course I would be glad to study Game Design there. I want to be a Game Designer for BioWare, the company who made Dragon Age and Mass Effect or EA who publishes BioWare Games and The Sims series when I graduate from a design school.It was when I was doing a Careers unit for school at the end of year 10, I wrote that I would be a Graphic Designer because it was close to a Game Designer. I then realised that I should just go for it and get a degree in Game Design because I love it and have been doing it pratially all my life. I would also love to travel the world and see lots of sights in lots of different places so that I can experience different cultures. There is so much out there for me to see and do and if travel is the only limit then I am going to work towards getting around it.</p>
