		<h1>~This is me: Meaghan De Klerk~</h1>
    	</div>
		<p> My name is Meaghan De Klerk and I am 16 years old and I am almost 6 feet tall. I live with my parents and have one brother and a cat.I am from South Africa specifically a little town called east london.I play violin but only started in 2013 and still learning. The fact that I'm stil learning hasn't stopped me from trying to play songs such as La vie en rose. I use to do Air Cadets more known as ATC during this time I met Jason Kerrison the lead singer from Opshop at the Ohakea air base. At the time I didn't know he was but I got a picture with him anyway because other cadets were saying he was famous. I ended up having my picture with him in the Air force newsletter/magazine because it was a special visit. After a coupe of years and geting promoted I quit to focus on my school work. I really want to go to America purely to go see concerts and go on rollercoasters and all the rides to do with heights. I like going on motorbikes and skateboarding my friends often call me a an adrenaline junkie because I always say I want to go on all these rides and things they find scary. I love music and like bands.  I can listen to pretty much anything I always say I wish I was as flexible as my music taste because thats how flexible it is. At the moment I'm into a bit of screamo or metal whatever you wish to call it hehe. my favorite band is of mice and men their music makes me really happy and people say you cant understand what they are saying but if you listen to it enough you can.

    	<p>I like to collect vinyl but my rule is to only to get vinyl of old bands because I love old bands and they always sound better on vinyl, it sounds more alive. the only reason I don't get new music on vinyl is because I know I won't listen to it because I can listen to it on the computer. I really like to draw I can sit for hours on end drawig and painting because I find it so fun and iteresting. but sometimes I can be really OCD about it because I sometimes won't go to sleep until I'm finished, I prefer to paint and draw. I like to game I am really into World of Warcraft which some people call dumb but I really like it an other RPG games.I like anime and this year I am going to cosplay as Vanielle from final fantasy xiii for Armageddon which I'm really excited for.

    <P>When I'm older while I'm at uni or after uni I would like to make youtube videos about random things for fun. I would like to become either a web developer or game designer anything with could really haha. I want to tour Europe and America and go to all the landmarks and rides and then hopefully live in america by a beach. I would like to have a main job and the little side jobs like waitering because I just want experience being one. I would also like to do a bit of photography for concerts and big events. I have always wanted to be a model and would hopefuly like to be one in the future but I feel that I'm a bit to shy for that haha.
