<p id="box1"> Hi my name is Jennifer , but please call me Jena , since it's much easier and quicker to say. I am 15 years of age but im turning 16 in just a few months.I have lived in New Zealand all my life , even though most of my family come from other parts of the world.I have lived in the city of Upper Hutt for 8 years, Previously living the seaside town of Titahi Bay.The two towns are much different then they seem,one having ocean views while the other has riverside view.When i was little going to the beach was a major part of my life.Every Saturday or so we would go to the beach and i would surf or bodyboard.Surfing helped me relax and control myself. We would stay untill sunset then go to my Nans which was just across the road for dinner.When i moved to Upper Hutt i no longer had that freedom.Their was no longer any waves or any sand to build wonderful sandcastles with.We just had a plain river, with rocks and leafs.We hardly get the sunsets because of the tall mountains standing in the suns path.It was a big change for me and i had to adapt quite quickly. With staying inside rather than going outside all the time with the ocean just about on my doorstep.Rather than going outside i would play games and read books to make up time. Occasionaly i would go to my Nans but hardly since she moved to out of that area.</p>
<p id="box2"> In time i adapted and made new friends after a couple of years, learning to love the evouriment around me.I read a lot more than i use to and listen to music .Good music.This helps me a lot for relaxing and trying to keep happy.I'm now starting NCEA Level one and i hope i exceed in it.I really want to pass and im doing as much as i can to do so.I visit my Nan quite more than i use and i help her out ocassionally.I go back to the seaside once in every short while to see my friends and to catch up.I havent surfed in quite awhile so i hope i do soon.The weather in Upper Hutt isn't as nice as Titahi Bay it may have less wind but its not as sunny as i hoped.</p>




<h2 id="box9"><u>My favourite bands:</u><img src= "Images/Curly.jpg" alt="curly_hair" id="curly"></h2>
<p id="bands"> I don't listen to the music that most teenagers listen to these days.. i listen to "heavy metal" and "pop punk" as my good friend tells me.. I class it as heavy metal but apparently its not.The music i listen to helps me relax and keep calm.I hope one day i can see some of these bands live even though they don't come to New Zealand i still want to go see them.I don't generally listen to pop music but i do listen to some alternative.Last year on the 7th March 2013, i met one of my most adored artists . Ed Sheeran. Me and im friends waited for hours and we where the only people their at his hotel.We waited and waited and no cars where arriving so we ended up dancing to kill time.When Ed Sheeran himself came out of a black nissan car that was parked beside us and told us to stop so we could move out of his way.Ed Sheeran is a lovely person hes so small and tiny but he has an amazing singing voice.</p>

<p id="box8"> I associate myself with Animals quite alot i have two cats, one named smudge who is 7 years of age and one named "cuddles" who is only just 3 weeks old.Smudge is a very chubby cat who likes to eat quite a lot he likes to lie on my bed and listen to music with me. Hes not a cat that tends to scratch or harm in any way."cuddles" has only just been born so i dont have him yet. I visit him every wednesday and cuddle him. He likes cuddles thats why i named him that he holds on to my chest and wines if i let him go. Hes about the size of my hand and i can carry him with one hand, i will have him in two months or so.Smudge is named smudge because of the smudge patches on his fur of white and grey.</p>
